= Magical Language Lyrical Lisp

Let's play in Lisp!


== Introduction

This repository has only text-data.
In order to execute the game,
download ``lyricallisp_free-X.X.zip'' from following URL:

  http://lyrical.bugyo.tk/download.html

Unzip it and ``lyricallisp_free'' directory is created.


== Execution

In order to execute the game with your data,
you must make ``nscript.dat'' and put it to ``lyricallisp_free'' directory.

You can convert text-data (``X.txt'') into ``nscript.dat'' with ``nscmake.exe''.
``nscmake.exe'' can be downloaded from following URL:

  http://www.nscripter.com/

Or you can also make ``nscript.dat'' with following commands:

% vi a.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  char b;
  while (fread(&b,1,1,stdin)) printf("%c",b^0x84);
  return 0;
}
% gcc -o a a.c
% cat *.txt > cat_data
% ./a < cat_data > nscript.dat
